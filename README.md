This is a fork of [MeshCore](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore) that adds
**mishmesh**, a standalone user interface. MeshCore's companion
firmware normally leans on a paired phone for most things; mishmesh
puts messaging, contacts, and configuration on the device, so the radio is
useful on its own and the phone is optional. It can currently do almost everything
without a phone.

It currently targets Wio Trackler L1 (pro).
E-ink support will be there at some point, I currently don't have a device to test it.
In theory we can support more devices with enough buttons.

The underlying MeshCore firmware is mostly unchanged; see [About MeshCore](#about-meshcore)
below.

### mishmesh features

- **Messaging** - direct messages, channels, and room servers, with delivery
  status, auto-retry, and path reset when a route goes stale.
- **Contacts** - favourites and per-kind tabs (people, repeaters, rooms),
  rename, ping, telemetry requests, and path management.
- **Repeater management** - log in to a repeater and configure it from the
  device: settings, access list, neighbours, region.
- **Clock** - stopwatch, timer, alarm, and a world clock with DST-aware
  timezones.
- **Airtime** - live duty-cycle and airtime usage against the TX budget.
- **Adverts and sharing** - send adverts and share contacts/channels as QR.
- **Settings on-device** - radio config (frequency, bandwidth, spreading
  factor, TX power), screen sleep, sound, and timezone.
- **First-boot onboarding** - a short wizard for name, region, and time.

### Install

Grab the latest `WioTrackerL1_companion_radio_*_mishmesh-*.uf2` from
[Releases](../../releases), then:

1. Plug the Wio Tracker L1 into USB.
2. Double-tap reset. It mounts as a USB drive.
3. Drop the `.uf2` onto it. It reboots into mishmesh.

The `ble` build pairs with the phone/web app over Bluetooth; the `usb` build
talks over USB serial. Either way the device is fully usable on its own.

Or [build it yourself](#building-from-source).

### ThinkNode M5 quick guide

#### Controls (ui-new)

On ThinkNode M5 (single user button), the current `ui-new` controls are:

- **Single click**: next page
- **Double click**: previous page
- **Long press**: enter / page action
- **Triple click**: select action

Page-specific actions:

- **Node page**: long press sends advert
- **Settings page**:
  - long press toggles BLE/serial
  - triple click toggles GPS
- **Map page**:
  - triple click clears track breadcrumbs
  - long press cycles map mode label
- **Power page**: long press hibernates

#### Flashing onto ThinkNode M5

If you are building from this repository:

```sh
export FIRMWARE_VERSION=mishmesh-dev
pio run -e ThinkNode_M5_companion_radio_ble -t upload
# or:
pio run -e ThinkNode_M5_companion_radio_usb -t upload
```

- Use `*_ble` if you want Bluetooth pairing with the phone/web app.
- Use `*_usb` if you want USB serial companion mode.

If upload does not start, put the board in ROM bootloader mode (hold **BOOT**,
tap **RESET**, then release **BOOT**) and run the command again.

If you prefer prebuilt files, download the ThinkNode M5 companion firmware from
the release/flasher page and flash with the ESP32 web flasher or `esptool`.

### Building from source

A PlatformIO project. With the repo cloned:

```sh
export FIRMWARE_VERSION=mishmesh-dev
pio run -e WioTrackerL1_companion_radio_usb_mishmesh -t upload   # or _ble_mishmesh
```

Package the `.uf2` / `.zip` like a release does (lands in `out/`):

```sh
export FIRMWARE_VERSION=mishmesh-dev
sh build.sh build-firmware WioTrackerL1_companion_radio_usb_mishmesh
```

### Emoji

Emoji use the [EmojiMania](https://idanro.itch.io/emojimania) glyph set - a
purchased license that doesn't allow redistributing the art, so the glyphs live
outside this repository. Official release builds compile them in. Building from
source, or any fork, is fully supported and looks identical, except emoji render
as a placeholder block instead of the glyph.

If you own EmojiMania, you can build with emoji yourself: drop your sheet in and
run the generator per
[`mishmesh/text/emoji-tools/README.md`](./mishmesh/text/emoji-tools/README.md).

### How mishmesh fits

The framework lives under [`mishmesh/`](./mishmesh); a thin adapter in
[`examples/companion_radio/ui-mishmesh/`](./examples/companion_radio/ui-mishmesh)
bridges it to the companion app without touching `main.cpp`. Screens are `Applet`
subclasses on a fixed stack managed by `AppletHost`; all drawing goes through
`Canvas`. Text and icons are bitmap fonts rendered with mcufont (Nokia Cellphone
FC, Tom Thumb, Pixelarticons); the logo wordmark is set in the LastPriestess pixel
font by Christina Antoinette Neofotistou.

### AI disclosure

It's mixed. I use AI a lot at work. Side projects are a way for me to keep my
programming skills alive. This project contains a mix of manually written and AI
generated (but manually reviewed) code. I used it more heavily in brainstorming
ideas and discovering the original codebase. Don't use this if you're a purist.

## About MeshCore

mishmesh is a fork of **MeshCore**, a lightweight, portable C++ library for
multi-hop packet routing over LoRa and other packet radios. The mesh core, the
companion firmware, supported hardware and the flasher, the phone/web apps, and the
protocol documentation all come from that project. For anything about MeshCore
itself, see the upstream repository:
